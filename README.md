# algorithm-and-data-structures-1-python
Python projects I did when taking a class about efficient algorithms and data structures
Lab 2 - implementing a Set
Lab 3 - implementing a linked structured list
Lab 4 - turns an equation into Post notation
Lab 5 - uses recursion to implement some basic math functions
